Hi Andrey!

As promised, here is the code review task we have setup to assess your technical coding skills.

Create a new Ionic ver 5 app by following the instructions here: https://ionicframework.com/docs
The app should be blank and use the Angular framework
Set up 2 "pages" (or modules) with different url routes. Each page should contain an Ion button that navigates to the respective page. It is acceptable to use ion back button from page 2 to 1.
Compose a service that connects to the "Star Wars People API" (https://swapi.dev/api/people)  
On page 2, display names of the people in an Ion List
Create a module that is displayed as a modal. It should contain an ion header with a close (dismiss) button in the upper right corner
Place an Ion button on both pages 1 and 2 that launches this modal with ionic's ModalController
Place your code into a Git repo and provide us with the link when you are done

Please return at your earliest convenience so that we can arrange to review internally.
